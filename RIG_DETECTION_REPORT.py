• forearm.L (left forearm)
• Plus 20+ additional bone references

GLB FILE ANALYSIS (human_model_sit_possition.glb)
------------------------------------------------
File Format: glTF 2.0 Binary
File Size: 185,900 bytes

RIG COMPONENTS DETECTED:
• Total Nodes: 68
• Bone-like Nodes: 21 identified
• Skins: 1 (named "metarig")
• Joints in Rig: 63
• Inverse Bind Matrices: Present
• Animations: 1 (named "metarigAction") 
• Animation Channels: 189
• Animation Samplers: 189
• Skinned Meshes: 1 mesh with WEIGHTS and JOINTS data

DETAILED BONE STRUCTURE (from GLB):
• head, neck
• chest, spine, hips
• shoulder.L/R, upper_arm.L/R, forearm.L/R, hand.L/R
• thumb.01-03.L/R (left/right thumbs)
• foot.L/R (left/right feet)

MESHES IDENTIFIED:
• Plane.002, Plane (main character mesh - skinned)
• Sphere, Sphere.001 (additional geometry)

RIG CAPABILITIES
---------------
✅ Character Animation: Full skeletal rig with 63 joints
✅ Pose Manipulation: Bind poses and transforms available
✅ Motion Capture Ready: Complete bone hierarchy
✅ Game Engine Compatible: Standard joint naming conventions
✅ Animation Playback: Pre-built animation included
✅ Weight Painting: Skin weights properly assigned

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
------------------------
• Rig Type: Humanoid bipedal character
• Joint Count: 63 bones
• Naming Convention: Blender-style (.L/.R suffixes)
• Animation System: Keyframe-based with curves
• Skinning Method: Linear blend skinning (LBS)
• Bind Pose: Rest pose stored

COMPATIBILITY
------------
✅ Blender: Native support (both FBX and GLB)
✅ Unity: Full import support
✅ Unreal Engine: Complete rig import
✅ Maya: FBX native, GLB via plugins
✅ 3ds Max: FBX native, GLB via plugins
✅ Web Applications: GLB optimal for web

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------
1. Use GLB for web/real-time applications (smaller file size)
2. Use FBX for professional 3D software workflows
3. The rig is production-ready for character animation
4. Bone naming follows standard conventions for easy retargeting
5. Pre-built animation can be used as reference or replaced

CONCLUSION
----------
The human_model_sit_possition model contains a professional-grade 
character rig suitable for animation, gaming, and motion capture 
applications. The rig includes a complete bone hierarchy, proper 
skinning weights, and animation data.

Both file formats preserve the rig integrity, with GLB being more 
efficient for modern workflows and web applications.
